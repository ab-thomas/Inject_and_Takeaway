Test 1
======
###Reopen the Array class or subclass it.
- Rewrite the inject method. Write a test for it first. Don't worry about returning an enumerator, assume a block is always given

- Name your method differently (that is, not inject() or subclass Array) because rspec uses inject() internally, so the tests will fail with a weird message unless your implementation of inject is perfect.
